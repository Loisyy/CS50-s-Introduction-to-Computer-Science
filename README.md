Carbon Footprint Tracker for Fashion
Welcome to the Carbon Footprint Tracker for Fashion! This project allows users to track the carbon footprint of their clothing items based on their type, material, and brand. The goal is to raise awareness about the environmental impact of fashion and help users make eco-friendly choices by offering insights into their wardrobe's carbon footprint.

Features
Add New Wardrobe Items: Users can add clothing items to their wardrobe by specifying the type, material, and brand.
Track Carbon Footprint: The carbon footprint of each item is calculated based on its material and other attributes.
Wardrobe Summary: View the total number of items, total carbon footprint, and average carbon footprint per item.
Remove Items: Users can remove clothing items from their wardrobe when no longer needed.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content updates
Backend:

Python (Flask) for handling backend logic and API requests
JSON for data storage and API communication

How It Works
Adding Items
Users can add items to the wardrobe by selecting:

Type: T-shirt, jeans, jacket, etc.
Material: Cotton, wool, polyester, etc.
Brand: Any clothing brand.
Tracking Carbon Footprint
Each item’s carbon footprint is calculated based on its material. For example, materials like polyester tend to have a higher carbon footprint than natural materials like cotton or wool.

Wardrobe Summary
The app calculates the following metrics:

Total Items: The total number of items in the wardrobe.
Total Carbon Footprint: The cumulative carbon footprint of all items in the wardrobe.
Average Carbon Footprint: The average carbon footprint per item in the wardrobe.
